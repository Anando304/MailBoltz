Acting vice-president of Research, Karen Mossman, in an update letter to the McMaster community, says that the new directives allow the university to begin to implement Phase One of its research recovery plan.
While working from home continues to be the preferred option for research, a process will be in place to open more research areas in a safe and secure manner.
Planning at the university is also happening in units across the institution as well as through the Crisis Management Group, Provost Council and the President and Vice-President’s group (PVP).
*Research activities to increase no later than June 1* New guidance provided by the province gives universities the ability to increase their research activities.
- Everyone who is not considered part of an essential service should continue to work at home, if they are able to do so.
Anyone who feels unwell should not come to campus, and should follow the advice on Ontario’s COVID-19 self-screening website <https://covid-19.ontario.ca/self-assessment/>.</pre> <br><pre>***********************</pre> <br><pre>COVID19 Updates</pre> <br><pre>"anando304 ." <anando100@gmail.com></pre> <br><pre>Because many health units publish tallies to their websites before reporting to Public Health Ontario, the Star’s count is more current than the data the province puts out each morning.
Still, as a whole, the daily growth in new COVID-19 infections across Ontario has fallen sharply since peaking at more than 700 cases a day in late April.
The drop was consistent with recent weekends, which have also seen notable slowdowns at both the testing labs and the assessment centres that collect patients’ samples for testing.
The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day.
The 5,242 new cases and 157 deaths due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours took the country’s infection tally to more than 96,000, the most in Asia.
On Sunday, the federal government extended a nationwide lockdown to May 31 but eased some restrictions to restore economic activity and gave states more control in deciding the nature of the lockdown.
He said the news was good enough to allow stores in the Greater Montreal area with a door to the outside to open May 25 as planned.</pre> <br><pre>***********************</pre> <br><pre>Microsoft Build 2020 Event</pre> <br><pre>"anando304 ." <anando100@gmail.com></pre> <br><pre>*Session catalog and scheduler* Get the details on everything that’s happening at the show and use the MyBuild session scheduler to create your personalized agenda.

GRID VIEW Apart from the raw capabilities of GPT-2, the model’s release is notable as part of an ongoing debate about the responsibility of AI researchers to mitigate harm caused by their work.
It particularly suffers with the challenge of long-term coherence; for example, using the names and attributes of characters consistently in a story, or sticking to a single subject in a news article.
Feed it a fake headline, for example, and it will write a news story; give it the first line of a poem and it’ll supply a whole verse.
OpenAI says it will continue to watch how GPT-2 is used by the community and public, and will further develop its policies on the responsible publication of AI research.
Experts have pointed out that easy access to cutting-edge AI tools can enable malicious actors; a dynamic we’ve seen with the use of deepfakes to generate revenge porn, for example.
The research lab OpenAI has released the full version of a text-generating AI system <https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/> that experts warned could be used for malicious purposes.</pre> <br><pre>***********************</pre> <br><pre>Reminder: Lessons From Product Teams: A Conversation with Shopify</pre> <br><pre>"Katie Flynn, Product Marketing Manager" <webinars@modeanalytics.com></pre> <br><pre><https://go1.mode.com/UXoA0eC09I0EgV019X00068> Hi Bell, Following up on my previous email, I will be hosting a webinar about how companies have used Mode to transform their analytics teams from service centers to business partners.
